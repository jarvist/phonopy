phonopy
=======

Phonon code. For the details, see http://atztogo.github.io/phonopy/

This version of the codes has been edited by Jarvist Moore Frost to provide a partial-density-of-states which is decomposed per-phonon. I'm not sure whether these edits would be generally useful or wanted by Togo, so have just left them here for future reference + use by other researchers!
